The directory for GLScene's system help, user guide, and po files with translations 
of captions, text strings and hints from English to other languages 
using GNU Gettext tools for Delphi, C++ and Lazarus.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The po files could be created, edited and used in the next way: 
- Download dxgettext-1.2.2.exe from http://sourceforge.net/projects/dxgettext/ 
  and install it on your computer. For Windows users there will be corresponding items 
  inserted to Explorer's menu. 
- Extract captions, text strings and hints from pas/cpp/dfm files in your project's directory  
  to insert it to a template default.po file. Right click by mouse button on appropriate folder opened in Explorer.
- Merge your project's templete default.po file with main translated samples.po file 
  if it was earlier extracted from GLScene\Samples directory. Right click on default.po file to execute the command 
  (the same could be done to merge a template with glscene.po updated by GLScene's developers).
- Download poEdit editor from http://www.poedit/net/ or http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/files/
  and make necessary translations in your additional text strings. 
- Save your po file from poEdit and gain compiled mo file. Usually you will have one mo file for each language.
- Download gnugettext.pas unit from svn page:
  https://dxgettext.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dxgettext/trunk/dxgettext-pachages/dxgettext/dxgettext/freepascal/
- Include gnugettext.pas into your project's uses clause, set paths to mo files in your program 
  and make language code selections (note: you can find also the last version of GNUgettext.pas in GLScene\Source\Basis directory)
- Choose the necessary language to build your application and execute your software with localized interface,
  that includes all GLScene's text strings, hints and translated messages.
