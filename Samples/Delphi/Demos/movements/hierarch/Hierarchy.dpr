{: This Form demonstrates basic "hierarchical" movements.<p>

	Our visible (cube) objects are children of TGLDummyCube object and we move
	them through rotations of the DummyCubes.<br>
	Movements in this demo differs from the "manual" demo : "earth" now spins,
	"moon" has an inclined orbit and spins too.<p>

	You may use any GLScene object when building hierarchical scenes, but it
	is recommended to use TGLDummyCube for structural (regroupment only) objects,
	since dummycube are just "virtual" at run-time and cost no OpenGL setup or
	rendering time.
