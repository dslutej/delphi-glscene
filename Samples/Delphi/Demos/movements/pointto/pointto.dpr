{: Demo/test case for the PointTo method of objects.<p>

   The PointTo method allows to easily orient an object to point toward another
   object, whatever their relative positions in the scene hierarchy.<br>
   In this sample, we have a green sphere turning in circle and riding a sin,
   while a blue arrow, turning in a smaller circle, is maintained pointed
   toward the sphere. The other items (lines...) are just here to help visualize
   the 3D nature of the thing.

program pointto;

  Forms,
  Unit1 in 'Unit1.pas' {Form1};

{$R *.RES}

begin
  Application.Initialize;
  Application.CreateForm(TForm1, Form1);
  Application.Run;
end.
