{ : Moving objects with the mouse.<p>

  In this demo you can move the two cubes around by picking and dragging
  them. This showcases the use of ScreenVectorIntersectXxxx functions.<p>

  You can also use the numeric keypad to move/zoom the camera and the arrow
  to move the selected object around.<p>
