{: A variation of the magacube bench for testing sorting.<p>

	The cubes in this sample are transparent, and as such need to be depth-sorted
   to render correctly, this uses an alternate sorting code which this benchmark
   helps testing. The sorting mode is osRenderBlended last, which isn't the most
   efficient for that particular case (as a matter of fact, this bench is a worst
   case situation for osRenderBlendedLast), osRenderFarthestFirst would be more
   suited since all the objets must be sorted (osRenderBlendedLast attempts
   ta take advantange of the fact that only a fraction of the objects must be
   depth-sorted, which is a disadvantage if most of them must be sorted).<p>
