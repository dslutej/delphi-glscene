{: This samples shows how to use a material library for texture animation.<p>

   Texture animation is best handled via material switching (from a material
   library). Directly updating the texture image can get slow because of the
   overhead induces by preparing and uploading the texture to the 3D board.<p>

   In this sample, we prepare a set of textures in a material library,
   then simply switch between them in a cadencer's "Progress" event.
