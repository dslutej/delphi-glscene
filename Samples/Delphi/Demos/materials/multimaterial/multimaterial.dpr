{: Basic GLMultiMaterialShader example.<p>

   The GLMultiMaterialShader applies a pass for each material in
   the assigned MaterialLibrary. This example shows how to apply
   three blended textures to an object.

   A fourth texture is used in the specular pass to map the area
   affected by the chrome-like shine.
