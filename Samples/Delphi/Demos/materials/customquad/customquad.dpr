{: Using materials in a TGLDirectOpenGL OnRender.<p>

   This demo shows how to dynamically create materials in a material library
   and use them in a TGLDirectOpenGL to render your own stuff.<br>
   The render is quite simple: two quads, each with its own texture. The
   TGLDirectOpenGL is placed in a small hierarchy with a torus and dummy cube,
   and the rotation animation are handled by those two object to show that
   the OnRender code uses the hierarchy.
