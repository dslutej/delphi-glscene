{: Demo/sample/testbed for RayCastIntersect.<p>

   The RayCastIntersect aims at determining an as precise as possible collision
   detection between a ray and and object. With the intersection point is also
   returned the normal (which can be used for things like bouncing).<p>

   In this sample, this mechanism is used to implement a two-cents-worth
   raytracer, simply by throwing rays for each point in a raster image.
   That is what raytracers do, but they go beyond throwing simple rays ;)
   The intersection's normal and intersected  object's material are then used
   to calculate a basic lighting.<p>

   To calculate the raytraced/raycasted image, just hit the "cast" button.<p>

   Note: the quadric solver used for calculating torus intersection lacks
         precision and may demonstrate small holes...
