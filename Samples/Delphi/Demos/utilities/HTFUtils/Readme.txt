This directory contains several tpcfg files corresponding to "standard"
DEM distributions, to use/pack/test them, you will have to download the
reference DEM data (be aware some span tens of megabytes).
You'll find links below to the providers of those datasets.

Use of HTF for redistribution of DEM data is free and encouraged as long
as original source(s) and copyrights of dataset(s) are appropriately listed
and honoured, and a utility to unpack the dataset(s) is joined with 
the dataset or a link/website made available.
