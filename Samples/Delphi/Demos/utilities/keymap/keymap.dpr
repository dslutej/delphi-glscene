{: Demonstrates how to check pressed keys and allow the user to remap controls.<p>

   The panel react to the "key" written in their Caption property, default
   captions react to mouse buttons. If a panel is clicked, the user will be
   prompted to type a key, this key will then be mapped to the panel, by name.<p>

   Note the some keynames are localized and may differ between Windows versions,
   this is the case for most control and num keypad keys.
