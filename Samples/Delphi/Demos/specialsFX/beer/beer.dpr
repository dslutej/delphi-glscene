{: Beer demo.<p>

   The scene is defined in the DFM, the code only takes care of loading
   meshes, textures and reacting to mouse clicks.<br>
   A PerlinPFX is used for the foam, a simpler PolyPFX for the bubbles.
   The glass effect uses a texture in sphere mapping mode, the grouping
   of faces in the 3DS model does the rest.<p>

   Original idea by Vitomir Savic.
