{: Loading NURBS into a GLScene FreeForm/Actor object<p>

   A very simple parametric model of a duck, comprised of 3 NURBS
   surfaces. The Nurbs format is essentially the NurbsSurface geometry
   type used in VRML. One limitation at the moment is the Control points
   must each be on a separate line. Inverted surfaces are handled with
   the ccw FALSE statement in the .nurbs file (duck3.nurbs uses this
   setting).<p>

   Use the resolution slider to increase or decrease the models triangle
   count dynamically.<p>
