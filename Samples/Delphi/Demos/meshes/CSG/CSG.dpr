{  Demo of Constructive Solid Geometry in GLScene.

   Its kept very simple, you can use mouse to rotate view(drag)
   and mousewheel to zoom/unzoom.<p>

   The CSG system uses BSP to optimize what triangles it considers.
   Its kept on a mesh basis to simplyfy things, it allways generates new BSP's,
   even the meshes allready had BSP optimization.

   The demo uses the polyhedron.3ds, resource from the GLScene pack.

                      Sometimes a single tri is messed up...
                     often(1/3) happends on 2 triangles in this demo when using intersection)
