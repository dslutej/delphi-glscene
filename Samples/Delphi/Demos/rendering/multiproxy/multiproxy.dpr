{: Illustrates the use of TGLMultiProxy to perform discreet LOD.<p>

   The MultiProxy object is used to switch automatically between three models
   of varying resolution (since I'm no good at modelling, these are only
   three resolution levels of a sphere).<br>
   You'll find the MultiProxy under the GLParticles object in DCTarget,
   the TGLParticles object is used to automatically duplicate the MultiProxy
   and its settings (happens in FormCreate).

  Application.Initialize;
  Application.CreateForm(TForm1, Form1);

end.
