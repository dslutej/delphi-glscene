{: Basic demo for using the FullScreen Viewer and GLCanvas in GLScene.<p>

   This demo uses no forms, but switches directly to 800x600x32bpp fullscreen
   mode and renders a teapot with a colored light, hitting 'ESC' will leave
   full screen mode.<p>

   The demo also makes use of GLCanvas to render a custom 2D overlay with
   TGLCanvas, here a yellow reticle at mouse position.
