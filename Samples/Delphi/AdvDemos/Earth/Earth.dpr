   The atmospheric effect is rendered in GLDirectOpenGL1Render, which essentially
   renders a disk, with color of the vertices computed via ray-tracing. Not that
   the tesselation of the disk has been hand-optimized so as to reduce CPU use
   while retaining quality. On anything >1 GHz, the rendering is fill-rate
   limited on a GeForce 4 Ti 4200.<p>

   Stars support is built into the TGLSkyDome, but constellations are rendered
   via a TGLLines, which is filled in the LoadConstellationLines method.<p>
