{: GLScene Christmas "ScreenSaver".<p>

   Won't save your screen from anything though ;)<p>
   If placed in windows\system32 directory you need also to copy data there

   The scene is made up from a few meshes, some GLScene objects, several
   lens-flares and particle effects components, and a 2 text. BASS is used
   for the sound part (3D positionned fire loop, and mp3 playback).<br>
   Wrapped gifts appear around christmas every year.<p>

   Assembled from bits from the web, should be royalty free, but I don't have
   the means to check... so if you have clues about any of them:<p>

   Models: from 3DCafe.com<br>
   Textures: various origins, some from 3dtextures.fr.st, others made by me<br>
   Music: unknown origin, was in a "royalty free" download package<br>
